8-bit Snake Game with AVR!
Complete with the schematic, board design, and the program!
The board design can be implemented for other games, including tetris, car race and many more! (but no code yet...)
Note:
- The code is in C
- Already working as intended, but the pcb still need cleaning and can be shrinked.
- The Dot Matrix is in wrong angle, so physical and logical coordinates needed, and it takes memory space and clock. Will fix this for sure!
